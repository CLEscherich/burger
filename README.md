# burger

## This app uses mysql for the database and is deployed on Heroku for the live server instead of just a local host.

## In this app you can select a burger type, then is sends it down your list of chosen foods and then you can click on it to send it to the cashier and "purcahse" the food.

## I have included a screen shot of the finished app and what it looks like.
